  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I've been programming since I remember.
    I turned my passion into work.
    Experience has taught me that technology is just a tool.
    But I like my tools: **Ruby** (programming language), **Ruby on Rails** (backend development framework), Linux.
    I share my knowledge and experience.
    I'm a mentor at **CoderDojo** and at the **Rails Girls** workshops.
    I participate in conferences and local IT meetings, and sometimes, I present a technical presentation.

    - role: Full Stack Developer
      time: 2011 - Present
      company: Fractal Soft, remotely
      details: |
        Instead of creating websites for local clients, we started to implement long-term projects.

        Initially, we worked on the **casino online**.
        We've built games like slot machine (fruit machine), American poker, Blackjack (Twenty-One), American style roulette and French/European style roulette.
        The application had a management panel for moderators, which allowed to check the entire history of games played.
        My tasks in this project included prototyping and technical decision making, architecture design, refactoring and performance optimization, integration of individual modules, deployment, team management and customer contact.
        The project was written in **Ruby on Rails** with elements in **JavaScript**.
        We used animations based on sprites and CSS3.
        The whole app was well tested in **RSpec** and **Cucumber** with **Selenium**.

        In the meantime, we were implementing a web application to **manage ideas** called hitdea.
        I was responsible for designing architecture and implementation, managing a team of a few people and translating business requirements into technical tasks.
        As **DevOps**, I was also involved in building and developing network and system infrastructure as well as deployment of **Rails applications** to production.
        Acting as the **CTO**, I participated in key business meetings for this startup (San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Miami).

        During the end of the first version of the application we received feedback about the need to build a mobile application.
        We decided to divide the monolithic architecture into microservices and at the same time build a frontend that communicates with the backend via the API.
        Thanks to the use of **Ember.js** as a frontend framework and **PhoneGap** as a mobile development framework, we were able to quickly implement a mobile application.
        Although, a second, working version of the application was created, it has never been used in production.
        In retrospect, I consider the decision to build microservices as erroneous and premature.

        There were also many other applications in which I had my share.
        I created contextual advertising management application in **Ruby on Rails**.
        I co-created a system of linguistic analysis for Polish and English based on 6 million words and **Solr** search engine.
        I worked on linguistic games built on **Ruby on Rails**.
        I must also mention such web  applications as FutureLearn, SelectHub, purpura, or nopaperwork.

        As a programmer, my main task is to deliver well-done products.
        I like my job and my company.
        I am always open to work as a consultant, contractor or **freelancer**.

    - role: Web Developer / Project Manager / CEO
      time: 2007 - 2011
      company: Fractal Soft, Gliwice
      details: |
        I decided to become an entrepreneur and together with a friend I founded a small interactive agency.
        We implemented simple projects for local companies.
        We focused on providing websites, online stores and small applications in PHP.
        For web projects, I used **PHP** language, Smarty template engine, **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL** databases and **Magento** eCommerce platform.
        In addition, I participated in the design, preparation and implementation of the **embedded system** for gambling machines.
        The embedded system built by our team was called FSL4G (_Fractal Soft Linux for Games_).

    - role: Java GUI Developer
      time: 2007
      company: Wasko, Gliwice
      details: |
        I dealt with both internal and external projects.
        I belonged to a team of several people writing in Java, specializing in the implementation of GUI.
        Depending on the affiliation to the project and the project team, I used different Java versions and required technologies.
        One of the projects was a **SCADA** (_Supervisory, Control and Data Aquisition_) class system called OpenEye SCADA.
        It was a product for monitoring and management of industrial infrastructure.
        I achieved a module to monitor the activity of web servers.
        I have created the following functionalities:

        - query generation
        - impersonating the device
        - proxy connections
        - response analysis

        I also worked on the CallMax project.
        It is a Call Center / Contact Center tool used for communication between the company and clients.
        It enables the introduction of standards and optimization of telephone conversations, electronic correspondence and SMS messages.
        It's used for mass service of business partners and individual clients.

        I could develop my programming skills as well as knowledge in the field of network security and operating system administration.


    - role: Software Developer
      time: 2006
      company: Mentor Graphics, Katowice
      details: |
        I worked in a team that created DxDesigner - schematic editor for electronic schematics.
        This software was designed to assist designers in designing electronic diagrams, optimize their work and minimize potential design errors.
        I was responsible for the development of a solver based on logic programming.
        Most of the program was implemented in C++ using the Boost C++ or Qt libraries.
        The solver was realized in the language Prolog (**Logic Programming Language**).

        Application to empower people in creative process.
        The goal of the application is to support ideas management in project teams.

        The app includes several creative tools for asynchronous and synchronous operations.
        In technical terms, the first version was created as a monolithic application written in the **Ruby on Rails** framework.
        The next version of the application was based on microservices.
        All _microservices_ were in Ruby on Rails, and on the frontend side Ember.js was used.
        Additionally, based on front-end applications, a _mobile application_ was created using Apache Cordova.
        After a few years, the project was closed.
